# Grocery Sales Forecasting Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting future sales for grocery stores. The project leverages historical sales data to build predictive models that help in forecasting demand, optimizing inventory levels, and improving supply chain efficiency. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for minimizing costs and maximizing profitability in the retail sector.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** To predict future grocery sales using historical sales data and various machine learning techniques.
- **Scope:** This project can help grocery stores in demand planning, inventory management, and reducing stockouts or overstock situations by providing accurate sales forecasts.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing sales trends, seasonality, and identifying key factors influencing sales.
- **Modeling:** Implementing and comparing various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM for time series forecasting.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared, and selecting the best model for forecasting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Forecast Visualization:** Plotting and visualizing the predicted sales against actual sales for better insight.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM), Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
